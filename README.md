# terrorizer
ETL project


ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, LOAD) project.

We will read in data from multiple sources, transform the data by cleaning the data in desired form, and then write the data into a database for storage.

Our project will focus on global terrorism across multiple years dating back over the last 3 decades and then also pull in the population, GDP, and various worldwide governance indicators (6 total) for each of the different countries.
