ETL project


ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, LOAD) project.

We will read in data from multiple sources, transform the data by cleaning the data in desired form, and then write the data into a database for storage.

Our project will focus on global terrorism across multiple years dating back over the last 3 decades and then also pull in the population, GDP, and various worldwide governance indicators (6 total) for each of the different countries.  

The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories over the period 1996â€“2017, for six dimensions of governance:
All values are in estimates - Estimate of governance (ranges from approximately -2.5 (weak) to 2.5 (strong) governance performance)

Voice and Accountability:
Reflects perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media.

Political Stability and Absence of Violence:
Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism measures perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-motivated violence, including terrorism.

Government Effectiveness:
Reflects perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.

Regulatory Quality:
Reflects perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development.

Rule of Law:
Reflects perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence.

Control of Corruption:
Reflects perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests.
